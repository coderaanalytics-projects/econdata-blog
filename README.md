# EconData Users ðŸ“Š

[EconData](https://codera.co.za/econdata/) is a repository of South African macroeconomic data, enabling automation of analytical workflows that depend on public domain data. The **documentation** in this [docs](./docs/) folder gives an overview of what data are available in the catalogue&mdash;please use it! As explained in [`1_Installation`](./docs/1_Installation.md), the website portal to view the data itself is at [www.econdata.co.za](https://www.econdata.co.za/).

This GitHub repo is also available for users of EconData to submit source code on use cases, through pull requests, creating a community effort of shared code. We feature the code here on [www.randomsample.co.za](https://www.randomsample.co.za). Check out the [Discussions](https://github.com/coderaanalytics-projects/econdata-blog/discussions/1) tab to introduce yourself to the community!
