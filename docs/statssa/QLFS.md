where `year` and `quarter` should be the latest available quarter.

## Data Key

The data key contains four dimensions. The order of the `data_key` is:

LABSTAT.CATEGORY.AREA.SEX

The number of characters in the codes (as outlined below) used in the dimensions are 4, 5, 2 and 1 respectively, with full-stops between the codes in the data key.

When the dimensions are put together, 1143 concepts are available.

## 1. LABSTAT

"LABSTAT" stands for labour statistic, but this dimension could be referred to as the "variables". In most cases the concept is the estimated number of people in South Africa's population falling into the definition, based on survey weights. Some concepts are percentages (where `R` for 'rate' is used for the third character).
