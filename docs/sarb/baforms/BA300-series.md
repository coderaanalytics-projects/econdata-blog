The BA 300-series has been amended in line with the requirements of Basel III. Basel III is a comprehensive set of reform measures, developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, to strengthen the regulation, supervision and risk management of the banking sector. These measures aim to: improve the banking sector's ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress, whatever the source; improve risk management and governance; and strengthen banks' transparency and disclosures.

The reforms target both:
1.  bank-level, or microprudential, regulation, which will help raise the resilience of individual banking institutions to periods of stress; and
2.  macroprudential, system wide risks that can build up across the banking sector as well as the procyclical amplification of these risks over time.
